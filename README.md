# get-bruter
Passive get parameter brute-force tool,
works fast only in localhost lol, if u want faster tool use FFUF, 
my tool is only good for "ignore reflections count" future, which by my knowledge is absent in FFUF.
Why you need that future?
Well consider your ?ANYTHING=test get's reflected in HTML like this --> "x.com/?ANYTHING=test", this means any parameter's value will get reflected, and that's where you need "Ignore reflections count".
Also tell me if you want me to add up 
"add session cookies" future, if there is at least one person who will want that future I will add it up.
